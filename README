Python system and resource monitor. The simple and lightweight design allows for easy extension to provide all sorts of monitoring and reporting functions. 

There are 3 basic types that are used when initializing the monitoring framework:  Monitor, MonitorJob, and MonitorAlert. The latter two are base classes which you will either need to extend to write your own custom jobs and alerts, or use one of the existing types.

Example:

monitor = Monitor(EmailAlert("some.address@gmail.com"))
monitor.addJob(CheckDiskSpaceJob("/", 15))
monitor.addJob(PingJob("10.0.0.2"))
monitor.execute()

This will create a monitor with two jobs that will email the given address should either of the jobs report an error.  Simply add a python script with the above code to a cron job to monitor the system periodically.
